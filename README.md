connectFourAI
=============

This is a Connect Four AI I made with JavaScript that uses a minimax algorithm to find the best available move based on
a scoring heuristic.  It looks four moves ahead and as you can see it misses some moves here and there, but performs 
pretty well overall.  To keep the files organized I used Browserify.
